# odin-landing-page
[Landing page project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/landing-page) as part of The Odin Project

## Goal
Build the landing page fully from scratch based on the provided design specs.

## Reflections
- This was a fun challenge, completed in a few hours.
- I found myself trying to recreate the design a little too exactly in terms of spacing (padding, margins, etc.)
- One thing I need to learn more about is the flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis. I don't have a firm grasp on how to implement those effectively.
